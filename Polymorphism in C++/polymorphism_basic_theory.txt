Polymorphism in C++ means "one name - many forms"

It is broadly classified into two categories namely Compile Time Polymorphism and Run Time Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism can be achieved by two methods namely Function Overloading and Operator Overloading

Run Time Polymorphism involves concepts of Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
