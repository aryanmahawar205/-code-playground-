Most of the Arithmetic Operators can be overloaded in C++

There are a few inbuilt operators which hold special meaning to the compiler which cannot be overloaded under any circumstances...

They are - Scope Resolution Operator (::)
	 - sizeof() Operator
	 - member selector / dot Operator (.)
	 - member pointer selector / star Operator (*)
	 - Ternary Operator (?:)
	 - Object Type Operator (typeid)
